# Stock_Market_Analysis# üìà Stock Market Forecasting with ARIMA, LSTM & Prophet

This project analyzes and forecasts TCS stock prices using three different models: ARIMA, LSTM, and Facebook Prophet.

## üìä Problem Statement
To predict future stock prices using time series forecasting techniques and compare different models on performance.

## üîß Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM)
- Statsmodels (for ARIMA)
- Prophet (for trend forecasting)

## üß† Models Used

| Model     | Description                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| ARIMA     | Traditional statistical time series model |
| LSTM      | Deep learning RNN-based model             |
| Prophet   | Additive model by Facebook (trend/season) |

---

## üìà Results

| Model   | RMSE (example) |
|---------|----------------|
| ARIMA   | 29.65          |
| LSTM    | 21.34          |
| Prophet | 23.50          |

> Lower RMSE indicates better performance.
